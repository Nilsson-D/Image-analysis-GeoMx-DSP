# Image-analysis-GeoMx-DSP

## Description

This repo contains information and code used for analysing images from the GeoMx digital spatial profiler for the T-cell paper (add link). The images were stained with 4 markers.

## Software and libraries
The image analysis was performed with the open source software QuPath. 

The nuclei segmentation was performed with a fine-tuned "nuclei" Cellpose model using the Cellpose GUI. The "cyto" model was fine-tuned for the cytoplasm segmentation.

## Data analysis workflow
Will be made available when paper is out
